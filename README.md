According to an article by Forbes even undergraduate women from Harvard believe that when they are going to earn they will get 78 cents on a dollar compared to men just because they are women. Those women admitted to Harvard can be distinguished from the smartest, most talented and most dedicated of their high school peers but even if they can freak out over the issue, we feel anyone can feel the same. Being a woman dominated group (“in the number of participants”) we are very much concerned that all of our hard work should not become a victim of gender bias if it exists. Here, we found our way to start our analysis of this critical issue of PAY wage gap in the USA. We were five team members in a team and everyone is responsible for their parts of project done.
